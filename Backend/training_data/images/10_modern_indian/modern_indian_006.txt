The image portrays a modern Indian-style living room bathed in natural light from large windows that offer a view of lush greenery outside. The furniture is arranged to create a welcoming seating area, with two plush sofas upholstered in a soft gray fabric, complemented by accent pillows in shades of beige and brown. A wooden coffee table sits at the center, hosting a few decorative items including a small plant and a vase with fresh flowers. The floor is covered with light-colored wood planks that add warmth to the space. On one wall hangs a framed artwork, adding an artistic touch to the room's decor. The overall color palette is neutral, with earthy tones dominating the space, creating a serene and inviting atmosphere.
