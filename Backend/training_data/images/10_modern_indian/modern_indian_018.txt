The furniture style is contemporary with clean lines and minimalistic design, featuring wooden flooring that adds warmth to the space. A plush beige sofa sits against one wall, adorned with throw pillows in shades of orange and white, complementing the red brick accent wall behind it. The room is illuminated by recessed lighting, enhancing the neutral color palette that includes whites, grays, and subtle pops of color from decorative elements like a green plant on the floor and a vibrant orange throw blanket draped over the sofa. The overall ambiance is one of comfort and sophistication, blending traditional Indian design elements with modern Western influences.
