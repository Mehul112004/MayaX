The image captures a serene living room bathed in soft, natural light from a large window with stained glass panels. The room is designed in a Scandinavian style, characterized by its minimalist approach and emphasis on comfort. A plush sofa, upholstered in a floral fabric, sits invitingly against the wall, facing the window. Adjacent to it, a wooden armchair adds an additional seating option. The room is anchored by a large bookshelf filled with books, suggesting a love for literature and knowledge. A wooden coffee table rests in front of the sofa, providing a surface for drinks or reading materials. The color palette is warm and earthy, with the natural tones of the wood complementing the soft hues of the fabric and stained glass window. The lighting conditions are subdued yet cozy, with the sunlight filtering through the window casting gentle shadows on the floor.
