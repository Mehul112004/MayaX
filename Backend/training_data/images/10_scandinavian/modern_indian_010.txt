Scandinavian style is characterized by its simplicity, functionality, and minimalism. In this image, we see a living room that embodies these principles. The furniture includes a gray sofa with a striped throw pillow, providing a comfortable seating area. A black armchair adds an additional seating option. The floor is covered in light-colored wood planks, adding warmth to the space.

The room features a large round mirror on the wall, reflecting light and making the space appear larger. Above the sofa hangs a piece of artwork with abstract shapes, contributing to the minimalist aesthetic. On the floor next to the armchair is a woven basket, adding a touch of rustic charm.

The color palette is neutral, with grays and whites dominating the space, which creates a calm and serene atmosphere. The lighting conditions are bright, suggesting that natural light is entering the room through windows not visible in the image. This enhances the airy feel of the space and complements the Scandinavian design principles of simplicity and functionality.
